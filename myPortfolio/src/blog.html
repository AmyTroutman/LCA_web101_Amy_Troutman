          God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Eventually, you do plan
          to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? This thing comes fully
          loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.
          Checkmate...

          Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the
          pirates don’t eat the tourists. I was part of something special.
          They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.
          Yes, Yes, without the oops! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys
          dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.
          "Dinosaurs eat Man. Woman inherits the earth."

          Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. You're
          a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do
          you need a manager? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste,
          pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up
          this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

          of engineers. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with
          whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
