        Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a
        nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually
        says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its
        ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in
        English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.” As Cicero would
        put it, “Um, not so fast.” The placeholder text, beginning with the line
        “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like
        Latin because in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

        Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College, is
        credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous filler text.
        In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was piqued by
        consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin
        dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
        Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text
        from the Roman philosopher Cicero. In particular, the garbled words of
        lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of
        Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted below: “Neque
        porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur,
        adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut
        labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.” A 1914 English
        translation by Harris Rackham reads: “Nor is there anyone who loves or
        pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
        occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him
        some great pleasure.” McClintock's eye for detail certainly helped
        narrow the whereabouts of lorem ipsum's origin, however, the “how and
        when” still remain something of a mystery, with competing theories and
        timelines.
