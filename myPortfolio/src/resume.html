                <p>Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. Just
                    my luck, no ice. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they
                    didn't stop to think if they should. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet?
                    Here's my chance.</p>

                <p>God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Must go faster. Remind me to thank John for a lovely
                    weekend. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied
                    with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.</p>

                <p>Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? They're using our own
                    satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.
