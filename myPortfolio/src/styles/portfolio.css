/*Robin...so way back at the beginning, they had us copy/paste a bunch of code for our landing page. 
In the html, the nav links all have a class called "has border". 
In the css, however, they refer to it as "has-border". So all this time, those stupid nav links
weren't being styled by .has-border, but instead by the nav a selector I was using. */
